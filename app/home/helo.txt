the data structure in these json files are mentioned above
now this each result is like this

if i write a keyword lets suppose "T" it should give result as make names such as Toyota and Tata Motors
then if i write "tyt" it should just display Toyota and things like this
if make is detected then go look into models... like "tyt co" -> Toyota corolla
ir "Toyota Corolla"=> Toyota Corolla if model is also detected then go to versions 
"tyt corola x" -> toyota corolla XLi, toyota corolla XLi Plus
if nothing comes up then display nothing 

i waqnt to you treat it like this

make model version..
if version does not exist display make and model name
if model too does not exist then go for make only
if still then no display

const search = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>search</Text>
      //ADD INPUT HERE

      AND MAP RESULT HERE
    </View>
  )
}

export default search
